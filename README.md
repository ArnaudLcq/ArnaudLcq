Introduction
Welcome to my Github profile! I'm a software developer who loves to use technology to solve real-world problems. I have a strong background in multiple programming languages and I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills. I am passionate about software engineering and strive to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

About Me
I am a French third-year student studying at EPITA in Paris, France. I have also studied at INHA University. I have always been fascinated by technology and the impact it has on our daily lives. My passion for software development started early on, and I have since dedicated myself to learning and expanding my knowledge and skills in this field. I am fluent in French and English and currently learning Korean, which I believe will be valuable in my future career.

I have experience working with C, Python, Java, C#, and C++. I am proficient in these programming languages and have a solid understanding of their syntax, data structures, algorithms, and paradigms.

Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

A video game FPS project
In this project, I built a first-person shooter video game from scratch. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of game development and programming concepts, such as 3D graphics, game engines, and user interaction.

A SUDO OCR in C
I created an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system using the C programming language. This project required me to implement image processing algorithms and to develop a system that could accurately recognize and extract text from images.

A shell in C
In this project, I built a shell in C. A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. I designed and implemented the shell's core functionality, including input parsing, command execution, and environment variables management.

Current Focus
I am currently working on building my own FlipperZero with other friends. This project is a great opportunity for me to apply my knowledge of electronics, programming, and teamwork. I am also always looking to learn new programming languages and to expand my skill set. In addition, I am working on creating a database of basic algorithms, which will be a valuable resource for me and others in the future.

Contributions
Since I am currently focused on personal projects and learning new skills, I have not made any contributions to open-source projects. However, I am always open to opportunities to contribute and to collaborate with others in the software development community.
